# Linux Admin Mode Implementation Plan

Goal: add a Linux-only admin mode that lets FMQml perform a small, explicit set
of privileged local file operations without relaunching the GUI as root. The GUI
process, QML, previews, plugins, thumbnails, launch/open logic, and normal file
panels stay unprivileged. Privileged work goes through a narrow helper after
system authentication.

The user experience must be reasonable: do not ask for the password every few
seconds during a planned batch, but also do not store the root password or turn
FMQml into a permanent root session.

## 1. Product Scope

### 1.1. User-facing behavior

Initial supported workflows:

- unlock admin mode through the system authentication agent;
- copy one or more local files into `/etc`, `/usr/local`, `/opt`, or another
  protected local directory;
- create a protected directory;
- atomically replace a protected file after explicit confirmation;
- retry a permission-denied operation as Administrator;
- see whether admin mode is locked, unlocking, active, expiring, expired, or
  unavailable;
- lock admin mode manually without restarting the app.

Later workflows:

- recursive directory copy;
- guarded same-filesystem rename/move;
- controlled protected-file editing through a user-owned temp copy plus
  privileged atomic replace;
- carefully reviewed delete support;
- privileged archive extraction only after the helper path policy is mature.

The intent is not to run FMQml as root. Admin mode is a route for selected file
operations, not a process-wide privilege change.

### 1.2. Non-goals

- Do not use `kdesu`, `gksu`, `beesu`, or desktop-specific wrappers.
- Do not relaunch the full GUI as root on Linux.
- Do not create a root shell, command runner, or generic file-provider backdoor.
- Do not let plugins perform privileged operations by default.
- Do not route archive/provider/remote paths directly to the privileged helper.
- Do not silently bypass permissions; every privileged write is visible in UI
  and operation history.
- Do not collect the root password in QML.
- Do not store the root password, Polkit tokens, PAM text, or sudo-like
  credentials on disk.

### 1.3. Relationship to Windows elevation

Windows can keep its native relaunch/elevation behavior. Linux admin mode is a
separate design: regular-user GUI plus a minimal privileged helper.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1. High-level shape

Add a Linux-only privilege subsystem:

1. `AdminController`
   - Extends existing admin UI/API without changing Windows semantics.
   - Exposes admin-mode state, backend availability, timeout, and lock/unlock
     actions.

2. `LinuxAdminSession`
   - Owns app-side authorization state.
   - Tracks idle timeout, last privileged operation, active requests, manual
     lock, and expiry.
   - Never stores credentials.

3. `LinuxAdminBroker`
   - Unprivileged client-side IPC wrapper.
   - Sends typed operation requests and receives progress/result/error events.
   - Owns protocol version negotiation and request ids.

4. `fm-admin-helper`
   - Small privileged helper, not a GUI process.
   - Accepts only a fixed operation protocol.
   - Performs root-side path validation and the requested operation.
   - Never executes shell commands.

5. `LinuxAdminPolicy`
   - Central policy module for operation eligibility, path classes, symlink
     rules, overwrite rules, denylisted roots, and test fixtures.

### 2.2. Backend choice

Preferred backend: Polkit plus a custom helper.

Rationale:

- Polkit is the standard Linux authorization framework for desktop privileged
  actions.
- The system authentication agent owns the password prompt.
- FMQml avoids password handling and desktop-specific wrappers.
- Polkit can cache authorization according to system policy, while FMQml still
  keeps its own visible locked/active state.

Rejected for normal builds:

- `sudo`/`su` with password written to stdin.
- Running the whole GUI as root.
- A long-lived general-purpose root daemon.

Fallback:

- A setuid helper may be considered only behind an explicit build option, off by
  default, with strict install-time ownership/permission checks. It is not part
  of the MVP.

### 2.3. Helper lifetime

Prefer request-scoped or short-lived helper execution. The app may keep an
admin session active for user convenience, but the helper API must still require
each privileged request to declare:

- operation type;
- exact source/destination paths;
- conflict/overwrite policy;
- confirmation token when needed;
- session nonce/request id.

The helper must not become a broad root service that accepts arbitrary future
commands merely because the user authenticated once.

## 3. Authorization Model

### 3.1. Session states

Expose these states:

- `Unavailable`: backend/action/helper is missing or incompatible.
- `Locked`: backend exists, app-side admin session is inactive.
- `Unlocking`: system authentication or helper handshake is in progress.
- `Active`: admin mode is available for eligible operations.
- `ExpiringSoon`: idle timeout is close to expiry.
- `Expired`: app-side session expired and must be unlocked again.
- `Revoking`: manual lock/revoke is in progress.
- `Error`: last unlock or backend request failed.

### 3.2. Timeout policy

Default: idle timeout, 10 minutes.

Rules:

- The user authenticates once, then can perform a planned privileged batch
  without repeated prompts every few seconds.
- Each successful privileged operation refreshes the idle timer.
- Manual lock immediately disables app-side admin mode.
- Expiry happens in FMQml even if Polkit still has a cached authorization.
- On expiry, queued future privileged operations must stop and require a fresh
  unlock or explicit retry.
- Session-until-exit mode is not MVP. It may be added later only as an advanced
  setting or package override with very visible UI.

This balances the two risks: password spam is hostile UX, but permanent
root-like state is unsafe.

### 3.3. Password handling

- With Polkit, FMQml never sees the password.
- The authentication prompt belongs to the system Polkit agent.
- No password or auth token is stored in settings, logs, registry files, or QML
  state.
- If a non-Polkit fallback is ever added, password collection must happen in a
  minimal native component, not QML, and buffers must be wiped immediately after
  authentication.

## 4. Operation Routing

### 4.1. When admin mode is offered

Admin mode is offered when:

- preflight detects the current user cannot write/create/replace in the target
  local directory;
- a normal local operation fails with `EACCES`/`EPERM`;
- the user explicitly chooses an admin action such as `Paste as Administrator`;
- a retry dialog offers `Retry as Administrator`.

The normal operation queue remains the front door. Admin mode is a route inside
operation execution, not a duplicate file manager.

### 4.2. MVP privileged operations

MVP:

- copy regular local file to protected local destination;
- create protected directory;
- atomic replace regular file using destination-near `.part` staging and final
  rename;
- cancel an active privileged copy/replace and clean partial output;
- progress reporting for byte-copy operations;
- structured errors mapped to existing operation errors.

Explicitly not MVP:

- recursive delete;
- arbitrary chmod/chown UI;
- privileged symlink creation;
- privileged archive extraction;
- privileged preview/thumbnail generation;
- external editor launched as root;
- provider/cloud/plugin privileged writes.

### 4.3. Later operations

After MVP is stable:

- recursive directory copy with symlink policy;
- guarded same-filesystem rename/move;
- cross-filesystem move as copy + verify + remove;
- protected-file edit flow through user-owned temp materialization + privileged
  atomic replace;
- carefully reviewed delete file / empty directory;
- recursive delete only with strong confirmation and denylist tests;
- archive extraction to protected destinations, preferably by extracting to
  user-owned staging first and then performing privileged copy/finalize.

## 5. Helper Protocol

### 5.1. Transport

Acceptable options:

- Polkit-authorized D-Bus service with strict action methods;
- short-lived helper process launched after authorization with private pipes or
  a private Unix socket.

Requirements:

- versioned protocol;
- authenticated peer UID;
- per-session nonce/request id;
- no shell strings;
- bounded message sizes;
- helper refuses requests from unexpected UID/session where possible.

### 5.2. Request schema

Every request includes:

- protocol version;
- operation id;
- operation type;
- source path(s);
- destination path;
- overwrite/conflict policy;
- expected source/destination file type;
- metadata preservation flags;
- confirmation token for high-risk operations;
- session nonce.

Every response includes:

- operation id;
- status: started, progress, completed, cancelled, failed;
- processed bytes/items and total bytes/items when known;
- normalized error code;
- failed path when relevant;
- user-readable error message.

### 5.3. Error model

Normalize helper errors into existing operation errors:

- authentication required;
- authorization expired;
- backend unavailable;
- permission denied;
- invalid path;
- symlink policy denied;
- not found;
- already exists;
- not a directory;
- directory not empty;
- read-only filesystem;
- no space left;
- cancelled;
- protocol/version mismatch.

## 6. Path and Safety Policy

### 6.1. Root-side validation

The helper must validate paths after resolving them with root-owned logic:

- reject empty paths, relative paths, embedded NUL, URLs, provider paths, and
  archive paths;
- operate only on local filesystem paths supported by the specific operation;
- canonicalize parent directories with `openat`/`fstatat` style APIs where
  practical;
- avoid time-of-check/time-of-use races by operating relative to file
  descriptors;
- reject pseudo-filesystems by default: `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/run/user`,
  and similar runtime mounts;
- reject mount roots and top-level system roots for destructive operations.

### 6.2. Symlink rules

Default:

- copy symlinks as symlinks only when the operation explicitly supports that;
- do not traverse destination symlinks for replace;
- create new destination files with `O_NOFOLLOW` where applicable;
- for recursive operations, do not follow symlinked directories by default;
- show a clear policy error when denied.

### 6.3. Destructive operations

Destructive privileged operations are later-phase work.

When added, they require:

- exact target path in the confirmation UI;
- operation count when known;
- denylist for `/`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/boot`,
  `/var`, `/home`, mount roots, and pseudo-filesystems;
- no recursive delete without explicit strong confirmation;
- no root-owned trash/staging unless cleanup is robust and tested.

## 7. UI/UX Plan

### 7.1. Entry points

- operation failure dialog: `Retry as Administrator`;
- context menu/action for protected destinations: `Paste as Administrator`,
  `Create Folder as Administrator`;
- toolbar/status area: admin mode indicator;
- command palette: `Unlock Admin Mode`, `Lock Admin Mode`, `Show Admin Mode`;
- settings: default timeout duration.

### 7.2. Visual state

Admin mode should be visible but not make the whole app look like it is running
as root:

- compact toolbar/status indicator;
- tooltip/menu with state, backend, and remaining idle time;
- operation queue rows marked `Administrator`;
- warning accent only for destructive privileged confirmations.

### 7.3. Confirmation copy

Use operation-specific text:

- `Copy 2 files to /etc/nginx as Administrator?`
- `Create /usr/local/share/example as Administrator?`
- `Replace /usr/local/bin/tool as Administrator?`

Avoid vague prompts like `Run as root?`.

### 7.4. Safety disclosure

Show a concise safety disclosure before the first unlock in an app session, and
again only after the user explicitly asks for details or the app restarts.

The disclosure should say:

- administrator actions can overwrite or damage system files;
- FMQml itself will remain unprivileged;
- only the confirmed file operation will be sent to the privileged helper;
- the user can lock admin mode at any time.

Do not show this warning before every single privileged operation. Repeated
warnings become noise and encourage blind confirmation. High-risk operations
such as delete or recursive replace still need their own operation-specific
confirmation.

Suggested copy:

`Administrator mode can modify protected system files. FM will stay running as
your normal user, but confirmed file operations can change root-owned paths.
Review each target carefully.`

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1. `AdminController`

Keep Windows behavior intact:

- existing `isElevated` / `relaunchAsAdmin` semantics remain Windows-specific;
- Linux adds `adminModeAvailable`, `adminModeState`,
  `adminModeRemainingSeconds`, `adminModeBackendName`, and unavailable reason;
- Linux adds `unlockAdminMode()`, `lockAdminMode()`, `refreshAdminMode()`.

### 8.2. `OperationQueue`

Add privileged execution as an operation route:

- preflight decides whether admin route is eligible;
- conflict resolution remains in the normal operation flow where possible;
- privileged operations are serialized initially;
- cancellation sends a cancel request to the broker/helper;
- operation history records `as Administrator`.

### 8.3. `LocalFileProvider`

The provider may expose preflight helpers:

- can current user write destination parent?
- would create/replace/delete likely fail with `EACCES`/`EPERM`?
- is the path local and eligible for admin routing?

The provider itself should not become root-aware everywhere.

### 8.4. Editing and preview

Protected editing is later-phase work:

1. read normally if possible;
2. otherwise optionally materialize through a privileged read-to-temp request;
3. edit a user-owned temp copy;
4. replace through privileged atomic replace.

Quick Look and thumbnails remain unprivileged for MVP.

## 9. Packaging

### 9.1. CMake options

- `FM_ENABLE_LINUX_ADMIN_MODE`: default `ON` on Linux only when dependencies are
  found.
- `FM_ENABLE_LINUX_ADMIN_SETUID_HELPER`: default `OFF`.
- `FM_LINUX_ADMIN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`: package override, default `10`.

### 9.2. Installed files

Polkit backend:

- `fm-admin-helper` in trusted libexec path;
- D-Bus service file if using D-Bus activation;
- Polkit action file, e.g. `io.fmqml.fm.admin.policy`;
- helper version metadata.

Backend detection:

- verify action/helper exist;
- verify protocol version compatibility;
- expose unavailable reason in `AdminController`;
- do not show admin mode as active if backend checks fail.

## 10. Security Checklist

Before enabling by default:

- no shell execution in helper;
- no relative paths accepted;
- no QML password handling;
- helper protocol versioned and schema-validated;
- caller UID/session verified;
- file descriptor based operations where practical;
- symlink policy tested;
- protected-root denylist tested;
- provider/archive/remote paths cannot route to helper;
- cancellation cannot leave ambiguous partial files;
- `.part` cleanup is tested;
- operation history identifies privileged actions;
- logs do not include secrets or auth text.

## 11. Testing Strategy

### 11.1. Unit tests

- `LinuxAdminSession` state transitions and idle timeout;
- app-side lock despite Polkit cache;
- operation eligibility/preflight;
- request serialization/schema validation;
- path policy: relative paths, symlinks, mount roots, pseudo-filesystems,
  denylisted directories;
- error mapping;
- controller state formatting.

### 11.2. Fake-helper integration tests

Use an unprivileged fake helper in normal CI:

- successful copy/mkdir/atomic replace;
- progress events;
- cancellation;
- authorization expired;
- backend unavailable;
- permission denied;
- invalid path;
- protocol version mismatch.

### 11.3. Opt-in privileged tests

Run only in a container/VM:

- create root-owned temp directory;
- unlock through test backend;
- copy user-owned file into root-owned directory;
- atomic replace root-owned file;
- cancel large privileged copy and verify `.part` cleanup;
- attempt denied symlink traversal;
- attempt denied protected-root destructive operation.

### 11.4. Manual E2E scenarios

1. Paste into `/etc/test-fmqml` while locked; verify `Retry as Administrator`.
2. Unlock once and paste multiple files without repeated prompts.
3. Wait past idle timeout; verify the next privileged operation requires unlock.
4. Lock manually; verify future privileged operations require unlock.
5. Replace a protected file; verify atomic result and no leftover `.part`.
6. Cancel a large privileged copy; verify cleanup.
7. Verify Windows admin relaunch behavior is unchanged.

## 12. Implementation Phases

### Current implementation status

Completed so far:

- `AdminController` exposes Linux admin-mode state, timeout, backend status, and
  safety-warning acknowledgement while keeping Windows relaunch behavior
  separate.
- `LinuxAdminSession` owns app-side state transitions, idle timeout, manual
  lock, expiry, and refresh-after-operation semantics.
- `LinuxAdminBroker` defines a versioned request schema and has an unprivileged
  fake backend for copy file, create directory, and atomic replace.
- `LinuxAdminPolicy` performs conservative app-side validation for local
  absolute paths, provider/archive paths, pseudo-filesystems, and symlink
  policy.
- `OperationQueue` has a fake administrator route for copied local regular
  files, conflict replace through fake atomic replace, and create folder through
  fake mkdir.
- UI entry points exist for `Paste as Administrator` and
  `Create Folder as Administrator` in the command palette and file-panel
  context menus.
- Normal CI covers broker, policy, and session behavior without requiring root.

Current limitations:

- The administrator route is still fake-only and unprivileged.
- `Paste as Administrator` supports copied items only, not cut/move.
- Recursive directory copy, delete, archive extraction, real helper progress,
  and cancellation of helper work are not implemented yet.
- Real Polkit/helper installation and root-side path validation are not
  implemented yet.

### Phase 0. Backend spike

- Choose Polkit D-Bus service vs short-lived helper process.
- Prototype authentication and one `mkdir` request.
- Record package dependencies and install paths.
- Confirm default idle timeout behavior.

Output: backend decision note and minimal protocol draft.

### Phase 1. UI/session skeleton

- Extend `AdminController` with Linux state.
- Implement `LinuxAdminSession` with idle timeout and manual lock.
- Add toolbar/status indicator and command palette actions.
- Use fake backend only.

Output: UI can show locked/active/expired/unavailable state without privileged
writes.

### Phase 2. Protocol and fake-helper route

- Define versioned request/response schema.
- Implement `LinuxAdminBroker` with fake helper.
- Wire `OperationQueue` admin route for copy file, mkdir, atomic replace.
- Add unit and fake-helper integration tests.

Output: CI can exercise admin operation routing without root.

### Phase 3. Real Polkit MVP

- Implement `fm-admin-helper` for copy file, mkdir, atomic replace.
- Add Polkit action/service packaging.
- Add backend detection/version checks.
- Add structured error mapping.

Output: protected file writes work on Linux without running the GUI as root.

### Phase 4. Cancellation and hardening

- Add robust cancel handling.
- Verify partial cleanup.
- Harden path/symlink handling.
- Add opt-in privileged container tests.

Output: MVP is safe enough for real protected local writes.

### Phase 5. Later workflows

- Recursive directory copy.
- Guarded move/rename.
- Delete file/empty directory.
- Protected editing flow.
- Archive extraction to protected destinations after separate review.

Output: admin mode grows only after the core helper contract is proven.

## 13. MVP Definition of Done

MVP is ready when:

- Linux admin UI appears only when backend is installed and compatible;
- GUI remains unprivileged;
- unlock uses Polkit/system auth, not QML password collection;
- one unlock supports a short planned batch without prompt spam;
- idle timeout and manual lock work;
- copy file to protected local directory works with progress/cancel;
- protected mkdir works;
- protected atomic replace works with safe `.part` cleanup;
- provider/archive/remote paths cannot route to helper;
- symlink and denylist tests pass;
- fake-helper tests run in normal CI;
- opt-in privileged tests exist;
- Windows admin relaunch behavior is unchanged.
