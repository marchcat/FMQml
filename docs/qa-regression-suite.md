# FMQml QA Regression Suite

This suite gives QA and developers a repeatable baseline for new FMQml builds. The focus is the file manager core: navigation, file operations, rename/delete behavior, access rules, native watcher updates, and UI synchronization.

Out of scope: theme editor coverage, deep visual theme testing, rare platform integrations, and benchmark-grade performance testing.

## Setup

1. Build or install the candidate FMQml build.
2. Create the QA sandbox:

```powershell
.\scripts\New-QaSandbox.ps1
```

The default sandbox path is:

```text
D:\QASandbox
```

If Windows blocks `.ps1` execution, use:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\New-QaSandbox.ps1
```

To recreate the sandbox:

```powershell
.\scripts\New-QaSandbox.ps1 -Clean
```

To create a larger dataset:

```powershell
.\scripts\New-QaSandbox.ps1 -BulkCount 1000 -NestedDepth 5
```

3. Open FMQml and navigate both panels into different folders inside `D:\QASandbox`.
4. For watcher tests, keep a separate PowerShell window or Explorer open and mutate files outside FMQml.
5. For every failed case, record build id, OS, exact steps, expected result, actual result, repro rate, and attachments.

## High Priority Areas

Run these carefully during the current stabilization campaign:

- Single rename: cases 28-41.
- Batch rename: cases 42-52.
- Delete: cases 53-63.
- Copy, move, paste: cases 64-76.
- External watcher mutations: cases 77-87.
- Current folder externally deleted: cases 88-92.
- Permissions and access UI: cases 93-101.

## 1. Launch And Basic Smoke

1. Launch the application. Expected: both panels render, no blank or frozen window.
2. Close the application via the window close button. Expected: exits without crash.
3. Launch the application again. Expected: starts normally and state is not corrupted.
4. Switch the active panel with the mouse. Expected: focus and actions follow the selected panel.
5. Switch the active panel with the keyboard if a shortcut exists. Expected: active panel changes predictably.

## 2. Navigation

6. Open `D:\QASandbox` in the left panel. Expected: contents match the filesystem.
7. Open `Alpha`. Expected: path updates and folder contents render.
8. Navigate up one level. Expected: returns to the parent without losing usable focus.
9. Open `Copy Source`, which contains a space in the name. Expected: path and contents render correctly.
10. Open `Nested\Level-01\...`. Expected: deep navigation works without UI errors.
11. Refresh the current folder if refresh is available. Expected: no duplicated or missing entries.
12. Navigate the right panel to a different sandbox folder. Expected: panels remain independent.
13. Navigate both panels to the same folder. Expected: both show the same contents without selection/focus conflicts.

## 3. Selection And Active Panel

14. Select one file. Expected: actions match a single-file selection.
15. Select several adjacent files. Expected: selection count/status is correct.
16. Select files and folders together. Expected: only valid operations are enabled.
17. Clear selection. Expected: selection state is cleared.
18. Switch the active panel after selecting items. Expected: selection does not migrate between panels.
19. Open the context menu on a selected file. Expected: items apply to the selected file.
20. Open the context menu on empty space. Expected: items apply to the current folder.
21. Run a keyboard command while the right panel is focused. Expected: action applies to the right panel.

## 4. Create

FMQml create actions generate the new file/folder name themselves. They do not currently ask for an arbitrary name during creation. Invalid-name validation must be tested through rename.

22. Create a folder with the application command. Expected: a folder appears and watcher/UI do not duplicate it.
23. Create a file with the application command. Expected: a file appears and remains visible after refresh.
24. Create several files/folders in a row. Expected: generated names do not conflict.
25. Create a file, then immediately refresh. Expected: file remains visible and is not duplicated.
26. Create a folder, then immediately enter it. Expected: navigation succeeds.
27. Create in both panels sequentially. Expected: each panel updates only for its current folder.

## 5. Single Rename

28. Rename a normal file. Expected: old name disappears, new name appears, selection/focus stay coherent.
29. Rename a folder. Expected: folder is accessible under the new name and contents are preserved.
30. Rename a file to a name containing spaces. Expected: operation succeeds.
31. Rename a file to a mixed-case name. Expected: displayed case exactly matches the filesystem.
32. Perform a Windows case-only rename: `case_only.txt` -> `Case_Only.txt`. Expected: not treated as a conflict and displayed case updates.
33. Rename `Alpha` externally or through FMQml and refresh. Expected: displayed case does not randomly drift to lowercase.
34. Rename a file to an existing name. Expected: conflict is reported and no silent overwrite happens.
35. Rename a file, then immediately delete it. Expected: the new path is used.
36. Rename a file, then immediately copy it to the other panel. Expected: the new path is copied.
37. Start rename and cancel with Escape or by leaving edit mode. Expected: name does not change.
38. Start rename and move window focus away. Expected: application remains responsive and result is predictable.
39. Rename a file to a name containing an invalid Windows character: `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, or `*`. Expected: operation is rejected or fails cleanly; original file is preserved.
40. Rename a file to a reserved Windows device name: `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`, or `LPT1`. Expected: operation is rejected and original file is preserved.
41. Rename a file to a reserved name with an extension, for example `CON.txt`. Expected: operation is rejected and original file is preserved.

## 6. Batch Rename

42. Select several files and apply a simple batch rename pattern. Expected: all selected files are renamed.
43. Check batch rename preview before applying. Expected: preview matches final result.
44. Batch rename with numbering. Expected: order and numbers are stable.
45. Batch rename with mixed-case output names. Expected: displayed case matches preview and filesystem.
46. Batch rename that conflicts with an existing file. Expected: conflict is shown and no silent overwrite happens.
47. Batch rename with case-only changes. Expected: preview does not show false conflicts.
48. Batch rename where one file is externally deleted before apply. Expected: partial failure is clear and app does not crash.
49. Batch rename folders. Expected: folder contents are preserved.
50. Batch rename with selection in the active panel while the other panel shows another folder. Expected: only active-panel selection is affected.
51. Batch rename swap case: `a.txt` -> `b.txt`, `b.txt` -> `a.txt`. Expected: if unsupported, scenario is blocked without partial damage.
52. Batch rename that generates an invalid or reserved Windows name. Expected: preview/apply blocks the bad items and source files are preserved.

## 7. Delete

53. Delete one file through UI. Expected: confirmation appears and file disappears after confirmation.
54. Cancel the delete confirmation. Expected: file remains.
55. Delete several files. Expected: all selected files are removed and selection is cleared.
56. Delete a folder with nested files. Expected: folder is fully removed or a clear error is shown.
57. Delete a file immediately after rename. Expected: the renamed path is deleted.
58. Delete a file that was externally removed before confirmation. Expected: app does not crash and reports/ignores cleanly.
59. Delete a read-only file. Expected: behavior matches app/OS policy with no false success.
60. Try delete in a protected or inaccessible location. Expected: operation is disabled by preflight or fails with a clear error.
61. Delete from the second panel through context menu. Expected: operation applies to the second panel.
62. Delete through keyboard shortcut. Expected: same preflight and confirmation path as UI button/menu.
63. Delete a large group from `Bulk`. Expected: queue/progress completes and list updates.

## 8. Copy, Move, Paste

64. Copy one file from left panel to right panel. Expected: file appears in destination.
65. Copy a folder with nested contents. Expected: structure and contents are preserved.
66. Copy several files. Expected: all files appear and progress completes.
67. Copy into a folder where the name already exists. Expected: conflict policy/UI is used, no hidden overwrite.
68. Move/cut one file between panels. Expected: source disappears and destination appears.
69. Move/cut a folder between panels. Expected: structure is preserved.
70. Cut and paste into the same folder. Expected: no-op does not create duplicates or corrupt history.
71. Copy and paste into the same folder. Expected: keep-both/conflict policy or clear error.
72. Move a file immediately after an external rename. Expected: current path is used or a clear error is shown.
73. Run a large copy while navigating UI. Expected: application remains responsive.
74. Cancel a long operation if cancellation is supported. Expected: partial result and status are clear.
75. Run undo/redo after copy/move if supported. Expected: operation is reversible or clearly rejected.
76. After copy/move, check current-folder capabilities. Expected: access state updates without waiting several seconds.

### Focused Drag/Drop Safety Checks - Default Off

Run these with `appSettings.useLimitedDragNDrop` off, split view enabled, and
both panels opened to different writable folders inside `D:\QASandbox`.

- Start FMQml with the default settings. Expected: internal opposite-panel drag/drop is off unless the experimental setting was explicitly enabled.
- In list/details/brief/grid, hover unselected item icons, names, row whitespace, and empty panel space. Expected: no ready-to-drag cursor appears.
- In list/details/brief/grid, select multiple items and hover the selected rows/tiles. Expected: no ready-to-drag cursor appears.
- In list/details/brief/grid, drag from an item icon past the drag threshold. Expected: no internal drag preview, opposite-panel overlay, cursor capture, or Copy/Move/Cancel drop menu appears.
- In list/details/brief/grid, drag from item text or row/tile whitespace past the drag threshold. Expected: baseline click/rubber-band behavior applies; no internal drag starts.
- Drag from empty panel space past the threshold. Expected: rubber-band selection starts normally.
- Drag from empty panel space and release over the opposite panel. Expected: no internal drop menu appears.
- Drag a scrollbar or scroll the view. Expected: neither rubber-band selection nor internal drag starts accidentally.
- Drop one or more local files from Explorer into an FMQml panel. Expected: external incoming file copy still works while internal drag/drop is off.

### Focused Panel-To-Panel Drag/Drop Checks - Experimental On

Run these with `appSettings.useLimitedDragNDrop` on, split view enabled, and
both panels opened to different writable folders inside `D:\QASandbox`.

- In list/details/brief/grid, hover an unselected item's drag surface. Expected: a ready-to-drag cursor appears only over the guarded drag surface.
- In list/details/brief/grid, select one or more items and hover selected item surfaces. Expected: a ready-to-drag cursor appears over draggable selected surfaces.
- Select one file, drag it from the active panel to the opposite panel, and choose Copy. Expected: the file appears in the opposite panel current folder.
- Select one file, drag it from the active panel to the opposite panel, and choose Move. Expected: the file appears in the opposite panel current folder and disappears from the source.
- Select one or more items, drag to the opposite panel, and choose Cancel operation. Expected: no files are copied or moved.
- Select multiple files/folders and drag to the opposite panel. Expected: the drop menu count matches the drag-start selection snapshot.
- Click an item without moving past the drag threshold. Expected: no drag preview, drop overlay, or drop menu appears.
- Drag a selected item past the threshold. Expected: internal drag starts and rubber-band selection does not appear.
- In list/details/brief/grid, first try to drag an unselected item from text or row whitespace. Expected: rubber-band/click selection behavior wins; initial drag starts only from the icon/thumbnail handle.
- Select an item first, then drag it from text or row/tile whitespace in list/details/brief/grid. Expected: internal drag starts from the full selected item surface.
- Drag from empty panel space past the threshold. Expected: rubber-band selection starts and internal drag/drop does not start.
- Drag from empty space, release over the opposite panel. Expected: no drop menu appears; only selection behavior applies.
- While dragging selected items, hover the source/active panel and other non-target UI. Expected: cursor shows forbidden/disallowed feedback.
- While dragging selected items, hover the valid opposite panel. Expected: cursor returns to the normal allowed pointer and release opens the Copy/Move/Cancel menu.
- Open the drop menu, then activate the other panel before choosing Copy or Move. Expected: the menu closes and the pending drag/drop operation is canceled.
- Drop over a file row, folder row, empty area, header, path bar, or footer in the opposite panel. Expected: destination remains the opposite panel current folder, never the item under the pointer.
- Start dragging while the operation queue is busy or while inline rename is active. Expected: drag is disabled or canceled without a stale preview/menu.
- Drag a scrollbar or scroll the view. Expected: neither rubber-band selection nor internal drag starts accidentally.

### Focused Incoming External Drag/Drop Checks

Run these with at least one panel opened to a writable local folder inside `D:\QASandbox`.

- Drag one local file from Explorer into an FMQml panel. Expected: the file is copied into that panel's current folder.
- Drag multiple local files and folders from Explorer into an FMQml panel. Expected: all non-conflicting items are copied.
- Drop into the left panel, then into the right panel. Expected: each drop targets that panel's current folder, never the active panel by inference.
- Drop into a read-only local destination. Expected: the drop is rejected with a clear status message.
- Drop into an archive, managed ISO mount, remote/provider path, or virtual root. Expected: the drop is rejected and no operation is queued.
- Drop a mixed batch where some destination names already exist. Expected: non-conflicting items copy, existing-name conflicts are skipped, and the status reports skipped items.
- Drop a batch where every item conflicts by destination name. Expected: no copy operation starts.
- Drop browser text, browser links, or other non-local URLs. Expected: no bogus filesystem path is created.
- With `appSettings.useLimitedDragNDrop` on, start an internal panel-to-panel drag. Expected: external drop overlay/menu behavior stays suppressed and the explicit internal Copy/Move/Cancel menu is still used.
- With `appSettings.useLimitedDragNDrop` off, attempt an internal panel-to-panel drag. Expected: no internal drag starts; external drops remain available.
- Drop external files into a panel. Expected: the internal opposite-panel drop menu never appears.

## 9. External Watcher Mutations

For these tests, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\Invoke-QaWatcherMutation.ps1
```

Execution Policy fallback:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Invoke-QaWatcherMutation.ps1
```

102. Sort by name. Expected: order is stable and displayed names keep correct case.
103. Sort by size. Expected: sizes match files.
104. Sort by modified date. Expected: recently changed files move according to sort order.
105. Enable a `.txt` filter. Expected: only matching items are shown.
106. Clear filter. Expected: full list is restored.
107. Create a matching file externally while filter is active. Expected: file appears.

## Minimal Release Gate

Run at least these for every new build:

- 1-13: launch and navigation.
- 22-27: create workflow with generated names.
- 28-41: single rename, including invalid and reserved names.
- 42-52: batch rename.
- 53-63: delete.
- 64-76: copy/move/paste.
- 77-92: watcher updates and externally deleted current folder.
- 93-101: access rules and capability cache.
- 123-127: dialog and keyboard parity.

If time is limited, use this high-signal subset:

- 32, 33, 35, 39, 40, 41.
- 47, 51, 52.
- 57, 58, 62, 63.
- 70, 71, 76.
- 77, 79, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92.
