# Local File Badge Icons Plan

This document is the implementation plan for extending the existing icon-overlay
mechanism from provider-specific folders and avatars to useful local filesystem
state. It deliberately keeps the first pass small: badges must communicate an
actionable fact which is otherwise easy to miss, not decorate every file type.

## Decision Summary

- Reuse the overlay composition already owned by
  `qml/components/filepanel/FileIconCell.qml`; do not create three independent
  badge implementations for grid, brief, and table delegates.
- Add local badges only for:
  - symbolic links, including a distinct broken-link state;
  - read-only / non-writable local items;
  - local filesystem mount points;
  - items pinned in Favorites;
  - archive files supported by the existing archive navigation flow.
- Keep filesystem classification in C++ and expose compact, stable model roles.
  QML may map a role to a visual asset and tooltip, but must not probe paths,
  test permissions, enumerate mounts, or query Favorites per delegate.
- Show one **primary state badge** in the existing bottom-right overlay position.
  A separate pinned star may occupy the top-right corner. This makes a pinned
  read-only symlink legible without turning each icon into a stack of symbols.
- For the primary badge use this fixed priority:

  1. broken symbolic link;
  2. symbolic link;
  3. mount point;
  4. read-only;
  5. archive.

  The full state remains available in the attributes column, tooltip, and
  Properties dialog. No item receives more than one bottom-right badge.
- Do not add Git, RAW, operation-progress, hidden, executable, MIME, or
  arbitrary user-tag badges in this pass. They either need another asynchronous
  subsystem or repeat information the file icon already communicates.

## Current State

- `FileIconCell.qml` already composes a native-folder icon with a bottom-right
  provider overlay, including a circular background and optional avatar. It is
  the correct shared rendering seam.
- `DirectoryModel` already calculates local attributes during enumeration:
  `QFileInfo::isSymLink()`, `!QFileInfo::isWritable()`, and an attributes
  text containing `L` and `R`. These facts must become explicit roles rather
  than being reconstructed from the display string.
- `DirectoryModel` already exposes `isArchiveFile`; archive detection must
  continue to use `ArchiveSupport::isArchiveExtension()`, not a second suffix
  list in QML.
- `FavoritesController` / `FavoritesStore` already own persisted pin state
  and expose `isPinned(path)`. That is the only source of truth for the star.
- `VolumeMonitor` and `QStorageInfo` already provide mounted-volume data for
  the storage UI. Local mount-point classification should be a small shared
  helper backed by that information, not an ad hoc scan in every model.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace the main native/bundled type icon with a badge.
- Do not show every POSIX/Windows attribute as a corner glyph.
- Do not make badges clickable. Selection, context menu, drag, and double-click
  semantics must remain exactly as they are today.
- Do not inspect remote/provider paths through local `QFileInfo` or
  `QStorageInfo`.
- Do not refresh an entire folder synchronously merely to update one badge.
- Do not use raw component-local colours. Badge surfaces and warning treatment
  must use Theme tokens.
- Do not create a generic tag/label system as a side effect of the Favorites
  star. Existing Favorites tags remain a separate feature.

## Badge Semantics

| Kind | Applies to | Meaning | Primary icon treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `brokenLink` | Local symlink whose target cannot be resolved | Opening/copying may not do what the user expects | Link glyph with error treatment |
| `link` | Local symlink or Windows reparse-point link that resolves | Item is a reference, not an ordinary file/directory | Link/arrow glyph |
| `mountPoint` | Local directory equal to a mounted filesystem root | Entering it crosses into another filesystem/device | Small drive glyph |
| `readOnly` | Local item not writable by the current user/process | Rename, delete, copy-to-parent, or write may fail | Lock glyph |
| `archive` | Local regular archive supported by `ArchiveSupport` | Enter opens FM's archive navigation flow | Archive/container glyph |
| `pinned` | Path recorded as pinned by Favorites | User deliberately marked the item for quick access | Small star in the top-right corner |

Rules:

- `brokenLink` takes precedence over `link`.
- A broken link must not be called read-only just because its target cannot be
  opened. Link state is based on link metadata; writability is independent.
- `mountPoint` is only for a directory itself, never its descendants.
- A non-writable mount root shows `mountPoint`, not a second lock; Properties
  and the attributes column retain the permission detail.
- `archive` is for physical local archive files only. Archive-provider
  children and `archive://` paths do not receive it.
- Pinned state is additive and always uses the top-right location. It can coexist
  with any one primary state badge.

## Architecture

### 1. Data Contract

Extend `FileEntry` with explicit inexpensive local-state fields. Suggested
initial shape:

- `isSymLink`
- `isBrokenSymLink`
- `isReadOnly` (already stored; keep it)
- `isMountPoint`
- `isPinned` is **not** stored by the local enumerator because it belongs to
  Favorites and can change independently.

Expose these `DirectoryModel` roles:

- `isSymLink`
- `isBrokenSymLink`
- `isReadOnly`
- `isMountPoint`
- `primaryBadgeKind`
- `isPinned`

`primaryBadgeKind` should be one stable string from:
`""`, `"broken-link"`, `"link"`, `"mount-point"`, `"read-only"`, or
`"archive"`. It keeps priority policy in C++, gives QML a simple rendering
contract, and prevents the delegates from drifting.

Provider models may leave all local roles false/empty. A future provider may
supply its own semantic badge only through an explicitly designed provider
metadata field; do not infer local state for a provider URI.

### 2. Local State Resolver

Add a small C++ helper, for example `LocalFileBadgeResolver` under
`src/core`. It receives a local path plus existing `QFileInfo` metadata and
returns local badge facts. It must not know about QML, icon assets, or delegate
layout.

Responsibilities:

- preserve the existing platform-specific reparse-point/symlink detection;
- resolve a link target only when the item is already being enumerated or
  refreshed, then mark a link broken when its target is absent/unresolvable;
- classify writability using the same effective user-facing definition already
  used for `isReadOnly`;
- ask a cached mount-point index whether an absolute directory path is a mount
  root;
- compute the primary-badge priority;
- never touch a path with a non-local scheme.

The mount-point index should be shared and refreshed when `VolumeMonitor`
reports volume changes. On Windows it may be based on volume roots/reparse
mounts; on Linux it should follow the project mount-info roadmap instead of
treating every `QStorageInfo` result as authoritative. During the first
implementation, root filesystem, mounted ISO, removable drive, and network
mount roots are sufficient.

### 3. Favorites Integration

Do not call `favoritesController.isPinned(path)` from each pooled QML
delegate. That would create needless QML-to-C++ work during scrolling.

Instead:

1. `DirectoryModel` receives a narrow pinned-path lookup/snapshot API from
   `FavoritesController` or a small signal-driven adapter.
2. On initial scan, the model marks each visible local entry from that snapshot.
3. On pin/unpin, Favorites emits normalized changed paths.
4. Each open `DirectoryModel` updates only affected rows and emits
   `dataChanged()` for `isPinned`; no directory rescan is needed.
5. Normalize through the same path-key rules as `FavoritesStore`, including
   platform case behaviour, before comparing paths.

Provider and virtual paths may keep their existing pin behaviour if supported
by Favorites, but this plan only promises local-file icon stars.

### 4. Shared QML Renderer

Generalize the provider-only overlay in `FileIconCell.qml` into two visual
layers:

1. `PrimaryBadgeOverlay`, bottom-right:
   - receives `primaryBadgeKind`;
   - uses the existing circular/rounded backing treatment;
   - maps the stable kind to a shipped badge asset;
   - has accessible/tooltip text supplied by a central mapping;
   - remains above native icons and below the selection control.

2. `PinnedBadgeOverlay`, top-right:
   - receives `isPinned`;
   - draws a small star and no text;
   - remains non-interactive and must not change the icon cell's implicit size.

Provider overlays and avatars must continue to work. Make the relationship
explicit:

- provider folder/avatar overlays use their current provider path logic;
- local primary badges use `primaryBadgeKind`;
- a provider overlay wins the bottom-right corner for provider paths;
- local paths use only local primary badges;
- the top-right pinned star can coexist with either.

Pass the new roles through `FileDelegate.qml`, `FileBriefDelegate.qml`,
`FileTableDelegate.qml`, and the grid delegate in `FilePanel.qml` to the
single `FileIconCell`. Do not duplicate badge geometry in those delegates.

### 5. Visual Assets and Theme

Add a small cohesive asset set, e.g.:

- `badge-link.svg`
- `badge-link-broken.svg`
- `badge-mount.svg`
- `badge-lock.svg`
- `badge-archive.svg`
- `badge-pinned.svg`

The assets should be recognisable at 16 px and 24 px, with no embedded text.
The broken-link variant may use the existing semantic warning/error treatment;
ordinary link, mount, lock, archive, and star remain quiet. Background, border,
and warning colours must be Theme-owned tokens. Verify dark and light themes;
do not hardcode new colours in a delegate.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Model Roles and Local Classification

1. Extend `FileEntry` and the local enumeration path with explicit link and
   broken-link facts.
2. Preserve existing Windows reparse-point behaviour while distinguishing a
   resolvable link from a broken one.
3. Add model roles for link, broken link, read-only, and primary badge kind.
4. Derive archive primary kind only from the existing archive helper.
5. Add unit tests for priority and local/provider gating.

Verify:

- normal file has no badge;
- a valid file symlink and directory symlink receive `link`;
- a dangling symlink receives `broken-link`;
- a read-only regular file receives `read-only`;
- a read-only symlink still shows `link`;
- ZIP/7z/RAR supported by current archive support receive `archive`;
- `archive://`, `gdrive://`, MTP, and Favorites virtual paths do not acquire
  local filesystem badges.

### Phase 2: Mount-Point Index

1. Extract/introduce a cached local mount-root index near `VolumeMonitor` or
   the planned mount-info helper.
2. Normalize roots and compare them to normalized local directory paths.
3. Refresh the cache on the existing volume-change path.
4. Add `isMountPoint` and include it in primary-badge priority.

Verify:

- filesystem root is classified as a mount point;
- a mounted USB/removable drive root is classified;
- a mounted ISO root is classified where the platform supports it;
- a normal subdirectory beneath a mount root is not classified;
- removal/eject refreshes the visible badge without stale mount labels;
- scanning a large folder does not call `QStorageInfo` per entry.

### Phase 3: Favorites Star Data Flow

1. Add a normalized pinned-path snapshot/query at the C++ boundary.
2. Inject/bind it into each `DirectoryModel` without introducing a dependency
   from the low-level local enumerator to QML.
3. Add `isPinned` model role.
4. Subscribe models to pin/unpin changes and update only matching rows.
5. Keep context menu, command palette, sidebar Favorites, and multi-selection
   pin actions as the existing authority for changing state.

Verify:

- pinning one visible file or folder makes its star appear immediately;
- unpinning removes it immediately;
- pinning a path in the other panel updates it too when visible;
- a renamed/moved pinned path follows existing Favorites semantics and never
  leaves a star on a different path;
- scrolling a large directory does not issue one Favorites lookup per delegate.

### Phase 4: Shared Rendering

1. Add the two generic overlay layers to `FileIconCell.qml`.
2. Route model roles through all three file views and the grid view.
3. Retain provider folder overlays and Telegram avatar composition unchanged.
4. Ensure badge placement scales with `iconSize` and stays inside the cell at
   minimum and maximum UI font scales.
5. Keep all badge layers non-interactive so existing selection-toggle hit tests,
   drag initiation, and context menus are unaffected.

Verify:

- grid, brief, and table show the same semantic badge;
- thumbnails still render above their base image while the badge remains legible;
- provider folder overlays and avatars are unchanged;
- pin star coexists with a link/read-only/archive/mount badge;
- no badge intercepts a click, drag, double-click, or right-click.

### Phase 5: Tooltips, Properties, and Accessibility

1. Extend the existing item tooltip composition with concise state text:
   `Symbolic link`, `Broken symbolic link`, `Read-only`, `Mount point`,
   `Archive — Enter to browse`, and `Pinned in Favorites`.
2. Keep translation strings in English source through `qsTr()`/C++ `tr()`.
3. Ensure Properties continues to expose the authoritative detailed attributes;
   a badge must never be the only way to discover a state.
4. Add accessible names/descriptions to badge layers where Qt accessibility
   exposes them.

Verify:

- keyboard-only selection and tooltip/help path can reveal the state;
- English source strings are translatable;
- a broken link is clearly distinguishable from a valid link without relying
  only on colour.

### Phase 6: Regression and Performance Pass

1. Add focused unit tests for `LocalFileBadgeResolver`, badge priority,
   normalized mount-root comparison, and Favorites update routing.
2. Add manual cases to `docs/qa-regression-suite.md`.
3. Measure a large local folder with badges enabled against the existing
   baseline. Badge calculation must occur during enumeration or targeted
   updates, never in a QML binding that performs filesystem I/O.
4. Run the normal release build and tests.

## QA Cases

- Create valid file and directory symlinks, then delete their targets. Expected:
  valid links show the link badge; dangling links change to broken-link after
  refresh/watch update.
- Mark a normal file and a directory non-writable for the current user.
  Expected: lock badge; normal read/open behaviour remains unchanged.
- Open a mounted USB drive and mounted ISO. Expected: only each root directory
  shows the mount badge.
- Pin a file and folder from the context menu, then unpin from Favorites.
  Expected: stars update in every visible panel without full navigation reload.
- View ZIP, 7z, and RAR files. Expected: archive badge and existing Enter/open
  archive navigation still work; an item inside `archive://` has no extra local
  archive badge.
- Check grid, brief, table, native icons on/off, thumbnails on/off, dark theme,
  light theme, minimum and maximum supported font scale.
- Check a large source tree while rapidly scrolling. Expected: no new blocking
  filesystem work, binding loops, delegate churn, or click/drag regressions.
- Check provider folders, Telegram avatars, Google Drive special folders, and
  Instagram/Telegram provider badges. Expected: unchanged visual composition.

## Acceptance Criteria

The feature is complete when:

- every local badge is produced from C++ model data, not QML filesystem probes;
- valid links, broken links, read-only items, mount roots, archives, and pinned
  items display the defined semantics;
- only one bottom-right primary state badge is shown, while pin state can coexist
  in the top-right;
- provider overlay/avatar behaviour remains intact;
- all file-panel views render the same state;
- no badge changes normal mouse, keyboard, drag, selection, or archive-open
  behaviour;
- mount and Favorites updates are targeted and asynchronous-friendly;
- release build, targeted tests, QA cases, and `git diff --check` pass.
